## Requirements

- PHP **7.4+**
- **cURL** extension
- **JSON** extension

---

## Installation

```bash
composer require codeswholesale-v3/sdk
```

---

## Basic Usage

### Creating the Client and SDK

```php
use CodesWholesaleApi\Api\Client;
use CodesWholesaleApi\Config\Config;
use CodesWholesaleApi\Sdk;

$oauthStorage = new FileStorage(__DIR__ . '/oauth_token.json');

$client = new Client(
    new Config('https://api.codeswholesale.com'),
    $oauthStorage,
    'CLIENT_ID',
    'CLIENT_SECRET'
);

$sdk = new Sdk($client);
```

---

## Architecture Overview

```
Client
 └── Endpoint (Products, Orders, Codes, …)
       └── Resource (ProductItem, OrderItem, …)
```

### Client
- Handles HTTP communication, OAuth2, retries, and errors
- **Always returns `stdClass`**

### Endpoint
- Represents a REST API group (`/v3/products`, `/v3/orders`, …)
- Converts responses into **Resource objects**

### Resource
- Immutable DTO (read‑only)
- Typed getters
- No business logic

---

## SDK Contents (by API area)

### Products
- List products (paged, resumable)
- Fetch product details
- Fetch product descriptions
- Fetch product images
- Safe synchronization for large catalogs (50k+ products)

### Orders
- Create orders
- Fetch order history
- Fetch order details
- Extract license keys from completed orders

### Codes (License Keys)
- Fetch ordered license keys
- Download text or image-based codes
- Base64 image handling

### Account
- Fetch account balance
- Fetch account details

### Security
- Fraud / risk checks

---

## Products

### Fetching a single page of products

```php
$page = $sdk->products()->getPage([
    'updatedSince' => '2024-01-01T00:00:00Z'
]);

foreach ($page['items'] as $product) {
    echo $product->getName();
}
```

---

## Iterating over all products

```php
$sdk->products()->getAll(
    function (array $items) {
        foreach ($items as $product) {
            saveProduct($product);
        }
    }
);
```

---

## Product Synchronization (recommended)

Safe and resumable synchronization using continuation tokens.

```php
$runner->runForSeconds(
    fn(ProductItem $p) => upsertProduct($p),
    30
);
```

✔ Safe for web requests  
✔ Safe for cron jobs  
✔ Continues exactly where it stopped
